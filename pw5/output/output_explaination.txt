To see the whole results, I follow the below steps:

Step 1: Run the code "python3 main.py"
-> Results: There are 3 text files including "students.txt", "courses.txt", "marks.txt" and 1 DAT file "students.dat".
---
Step 2: Find the file type of "students.dat" with the command "file students.dat"
-> Results: "students.dat" is actually a zlib file.
---
Step 3: Copy the file "students.dat" and paste it with the format ".zlib"
-> Resutls: There is a file named "students.zlib".
---
Step 4: Decompress the file "students.zlib" by using "zlib-flate -uncompress < students.zlib > results.txt"
-> Results: The file "results.txt" exists and shows the final results.
